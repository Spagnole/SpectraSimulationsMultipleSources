The following tool is used to produce simple/crude simulated gamma-ray spectra based on your input decay scheme
and compare to your real gamma-ray spectra
An example file using 56Co decay data to run this tool is included 

There are three input codes for these simulations
There is one code to simulate a singles spectrum and a second code to simulate gamma-gated coincidence spectra
There is a separate code called by both of these files to read the required input data
The required input data for both codes are the same

SimulateSingles.cc -> To simulate singles spectra
SimulateCoincidences.cc -> To simulate coincidence spectra
ReadInputData.cc -> To input the required input data

There are also two scripts to run with the example file
These are RunSimulateSinglesExample.cc and RunSimulateCoincidencesExample.cc
To run these examples, the user only needs to load the script in a root/grsisort session and execute the functions
e.g
> grsisort -l
> .L RunSimulateSinglesExample.cc
> RunFullSimulation()


ReadInputData.cc info
This is the first code that the simulations require.
This code is uses functions to read in text files and to open the root file
Step to perform
> grsisort -l 
> 	.L ReadInputData.cc
> 	ReadDecayScheme("TransitionList.dat"); //this reads in your decay information
>	GetEfficiency("MyExpEffnew.dat"); //reads in your efficiency data
>	GetPeakWidth("PeakWidths.dat"); //reads in your peak width data
>	ReadEscapePeaks("EscapePeaks.dat"); //reads in your relative escape peak intensity info
>	GetRealSpectra("ExampleFile.root","hgE_56Co"); //get your real histogram
>	GetSpectrumBackground(hRealSpectra); //extracts exp background!

Please see comments in code for more information!


SimulateSingles.cc info
Requires the previous input from the ReadInputData.cc code!
Functions	
	FillSimulation(); //fills the simulated full energy peaks
	FillEscapePeaks(); //fills the simulated escape peaks
	BuildSimuledSpectra(hSimPeaks,hBkgr,hEscPeaks); //adds the simulated peaks to the extracted background

Run the RunSimulateSinglesExample.cc with the ExampleFile.root to see the output!


SimulateCoincidences.cc!
This is the more complicated of the tools!
Again this code requires the input from the ReadInputData.cc code
It does not require anything from the SimulateSingles.cc code
The code requires the following functions be performed

	GetLevelList(); //requires no arguments
	FixTransitionList(); //requires no arguments
	CalcLevelFeedingAndGammaBR(); //requires no arguments
	FindCoincidences(); //requires no arguments
	ReduceGammaGammaList(); //requires no arguments
	FillCoincMatrix( Nbins, lower_bound, upper_bound ); //can provide desired binning
	GateOnSimMat( Gate_low, Gate_high ); //best to give same gate used for experimental spectra
	FillEscPeakSpec(SimMatProj); //must give simulated coinc. spectrum
	BuildSimuledSpectra(SimMatProj,hBkgr,hEscPeak); //must give all three spectra
